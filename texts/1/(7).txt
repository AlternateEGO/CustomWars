and your puzzles...
Look, there are people like Ross who need to shootfor the stars,
with his museum, and his papersgetting published.
Other people are satisfied withstaying where they are-
I'm telling you, these arethe people who never get cancer.
...And I read about these women trying to have it all,
and I thank God 'Our Little Harmonica' doesn't seemto have that problem.
So, Ross, what's going on with you?
Any stories?No news, no little anecdotes to share with the folks?
Okay! Okay.
Look, I, uh- I realise you guys have been wonderingwhat exactly happened between Carol and me, and,
so, well, here's the deal.
Carol's a lesbian.
She's living with a woman named Susan.
She's pregnantwith my child,
and she and Susan are going to raisethe baby.
And you knew about this?!
Your folks are really that bad, huh?
Well, y'know, these people are pros.
They knowwhat they're doing,
they take their time, they get thejob done.
Boy, I know they say you can't change yourparents,...
boy, if you could--I'd want yours.
Must pee.
Y'know, it's even worse when you're twins.
You're twins?
Yeah. We don't speak.
She's like this high-powered,driven career type.
What does she do?
She's a waitress.
All right, you guys, I kinda gotta clean up now.
Chandler, you're an only child, right? You don't haveany of this.
Well, no, although I did have an imaginary friend,who... my parents actually preferred.

Well, you may wanna steer clear of the word'dumped'.
Chances are he's gonna be this, thisbroken shell of a man, y'know,
so you should trynot to look too terrific, I know it'll be hard.
Or, y'know, uh, hey!, I'll go down there, and I'll giveBarry back his ring,
