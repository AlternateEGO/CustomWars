coffee!   You can do anything!
C'mon, cut. Cut, cut, cut,...
Y'know what?
I think we can just leave it at that.
It's kinda like a symbolic gesture...
Rachel!  That was a library card!
Cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut, cut..
Y'know, if you listen closely, you can hear a thousand retailers scream.
Welcome to the real world!
It sucks. You're gonna love it!
Well, that's it
You gonna crash on the couch?
No. No, I gotta go home sometime.
- You be okay?
- Yeah.
Hey Mon, look what I just found on the floor.
What?
That's Paul's watch.
You just put it back where you found it. Oh boy
- Alright. Goodnight, everybody.
- Goodnight.
Mmm.
- Sorry-  /- No no no, go-
- No, you have it, really, I don't want it-
- Split it?
- Okay.
Okay. You know you probably didn't know this, but back in high school, I had a, um,
major crush on you.
I knew.
You did! Oh....
I always figured you just thought I was Monica's geeky older brother.
I did.
Oh. Listen, do you think- and try not to let my intense vulnerability become any kind of a factor here-
but do you think it would be okay if I asked you out? Sometime? Maybe?
Yeah, maybe...
Okay... okay, maybe I will...
- Goodnight.
- Goodnight.
See ya....
Waitwait, what's with you?
I just grabbed a spoon.
- I can't believe what I'm hearing here.
- I can't believe what I'm hearing here...
- What? I-I said you had a-
- What I said you had...
Would you stop?
- Oh, was I doing it again?
- Yes!
I said that you had a nice butt,
it's just not a great butt.
Oh, you wouldn't know a great butt if it came up and bit ya.
There's an image.
Would anybody like more coffee?
Did you make it, or are you just serving it?
-  I'm just serving it.
- Yeah. Yeah, I'll have a cup of coffee.
Kids, new dream...
I'm in Las Vegas.
Ahh, miss?   More coffee?
Ugh. Excuse me, could you give this to that guy over there?
Go ahead.
Thank you.
Sorry.  Okay, Las Vegas.
Okay, so, I'm in Las Vegas... I'm Liza Minelli-What you guys don't understand is,
for us, kissing isas important as any part of it.
Yeah, right!.......
Y'serious?
Oh, yeah!
Everything you need to know is in that first kiss.
Absolutely.
Yeah, I think for us, kissing is pretty much like anopening act, y'know?
I mean it's like the stand-upcomedian you have to sit through before Pink Floydcomes out.
Yeah, and-and it's not that we don't like thecomedian, it's that-that...
that's not why we boughtthe ticket.
The problem is, though, after the concert's over, nomatter how great the show was,
you girls arealways looking for the comedian again, y'know?
I mean, we're in the car, we're fighting traffic...basically just trying to stay awake.
Yeah, well, word of advice: Bring back the comedian.
Otherwise next time you're gonna find yourselfsitting at home, listening to that album alone.
....Are we still talking about sex?
